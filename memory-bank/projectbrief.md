# Project Brief - Coding AI Agent

## Project Overview

**Coding AI Agent** is the autonomous software engineer of our intelligent trading system. This LangChain-powered FastAPI service operates as a complete AI developer, mimicking the entire human software development workflow from requirements analysis to pull request creation. It receives coding requirements, analyzes codebases, implements solutions, tests changes locally, and raises pull requests - all autonomously.

## Core Purpose

- **Primary Function**: AI-powered software engineering for the market-predictor service
- **System Role**: The autonomous developer that implements features and improvements
- **Business Value**: Accelerate development cycles with zero human coding intervention while maintaining quality standards

## Key Development Responsibilities

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Parse natural language requirements and create detailed implementation plans
2. **Codebase Analysis**: Review existing code, understand patterns, and identify optimal implementation strategies
3. **Code Generation**: Write production-quality code following existing patterns and best practices
4. **Local Testing**: Set up isolated environments, run comprehensive tests, and validate functionality
5. **Git Operations**: Manage branches, commits, and version control with proper naming conventions
6. **Pull Request Management**: Create detailed PRs with descriptions, tests, and proper documentation
7. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure code quality, test coverage, and no regressions before submission
8. **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinate the complete development lifecycle autonomously

## Autonomous Developer Architecture

```
Requirements Input → Analysis → Planning → Implementation → Testing → PR Creation
       ↓               ↓          ↓           ↓           ↓          ↓
   Natural Language → AI Planning → Code Gen → Local Env → Git Ops → GitHub PR
       ↓               ↓          ↓           ↓           ↓          ↓
   "Add Redis cache" → File Plan → Write Code → Test All → Branch → Review Ready
